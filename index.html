    <h1>Water resources of Australia</h1>
    <h2>Status of water resources in Australia</h2>
    <h5>From the tropical north to the temperate south, Australia covers many extreme weather conditions, 
        including tropical cyclones, floods, heat waves and droughts. Australia is a vast country, 
        stretching from the warm tropics near the equator to the cooler mid-latitudes. 
        Sunshine, weather patterns, rainfall and terrain vary widely across the country. Northern Australia, close to the equator, 
        enjoys a tropical climate with plenty of sunshine, seasonal rainfall and tropical cyclones. 
        Australia has a cool continental climate in the south and a Mediterranean climate in the southwest with hot, 
        dry summers. The East Coast has a temperate climate with no dry season and warm to hot summers. 
        But overall, Australia is a very dry country, with very little rainfall across much of the Australian outback. 
        The availability of water and the frequency of droughts therefore have a significant impact on agriculture, 
        communities and the health of Australia's environment.
        Therefore, it is very important to understand the water resources of Australia. 
        The Australian Bureau of Statistics often makes a survey on the rainfall and water consumption of people or industry in Australia 
        to make a unified plan for the water resources of the whole country.</h5>

    <h2>Variation of water use by different types in Australia over time</h2>
    <h5>In Southwest Australia in particular, considered a global drought hotspot, 
        rainfall has declined by more than 20 percent since 1970, resulting in a decline in stream numbers of more than 80 percent, 
        and our unique and fragile ecosystems are now facing serious challenges from climate change, natural disasters, 
        land clearing and other intensive human activities. In 1977, the Australian government proposed the concept of water recycling for the first time, 
        and included water reuse in key research, demonstration projects, and education programs. 
        In 1990, Australia entered the first phase of water reuse development, 
        which was driven by the development and implementation of wastewater treatment plant discharge standards. 
        In 1991, Australian state governments began to establish environmental protection agencies and authorities, 
        and set sewage discharge standards. As of 2002, there are more than 500 sewage treatment plants in Australia, 
        which achieve partial or full recycling of municipal sewage. In the early 2000s, 
        a decade-long drought prompted Australia to encourage households to collect and reuse "grey water" (bath sewage, etc.). 
        In 2005, Australia established the National Water Commission (NWC), 
        which developed the national Water quality Management Strategy guidelines for water recycling, 
        achieving a historic shift to using reclaimed water and rainwater as an important part of urban water supply sources.
        We know that rainfall and water use in Australia will also change over time,
        so the water use in Australia can be roughly analyzed in the current year.</h5>

    <h2>Fitting of industrial and domestic water use in different regions of Australia</h2>
    <h5>Australia's water resources are owned by the State and the day-to-day management of water resources is undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, 
        Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment. 
        The Federal Water Resources Management Board is responsible for national water research and planning, 
        coordinating the development and use of water resources, and providing policy guidance to ensure environmental water safety. 
        The state government implements ownership management of water resources. 
        According to the total water resources of each state determined by the federal government, 
        the state users are issued water drawing licenses for a period of 5-15 years, and the water drawing behavior is regulated through legislation. 
        Local governments have water pipe bureaus, the main task is to implement the water laws and regulations issued by the state government, 
        responsible for water supply, drainage and water environment protection.In Australia, water resources are very limited, 
        so different types of water must be reasonably distributed, otherwise there will be a situation of short supply. 
        Therefore, the relationship between different types of water use can be obtained by using the fitting of the dot plot. 
        In the selection of targets, we focus on the two large proportions of residents' daily water use and industrial water use.</h5>

    <h2>The proportion of rainfall in different parts of Australia</h2>
    <h5>In terms of rainfall, as mentioned earlier, the rainfall in Australia is a very unstable situation, 
        and different parts of Australia often have different weather and even extreme conditions sometimes. 
        So a chart should be made of rainfall in different areas to determine which area is currently receiving the most rainfall and by how much.</h5>
